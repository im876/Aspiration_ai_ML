Financial Market Analysis

This is a financial marketing internship offered by Career Launcher and AICTE to the data science skills of the students. 
This project has been divded into 6 modules covering differnet methods used in financial analuysis of stocks. <br>
In this project students are given stockes prices of various companies listed in the NSE(National Stock Exchange) divded on the basis of
their market caps.

Description of Modules:<br>
* Module 1: Importing data and categorising daily calls according to trends.
* Module 2: This module covers the plotting, basic technical indicators and our own customisation, and making trade calls.
* Module 3: Calculating Beta of an asset which is a measure of the sensitivity of stocks returns relative to a market benchmark using machine learning
(Linear Regression and OLS).
* Module 4: Making trade calls of whether to buy/hold/sell stocks by analysing previous data and focusing on the trends the stock is having.
* Module 5: This module explains the fundamental concept of diversification and the creation of an efficient frontier that can be used by investors to choose specific mixes of assets based on investment goals
; that is, the trade off between their desired level of portfolio return vs their desired level of portfolio risk.
* Module 6: In this module the cluster analysis is a technique used to group sets of objects that share similar characteristics. 
It is common in statistics, but investors use the approach to build a diversified portfolio. This is so because, 
stocks that exhibit high correlations in returns fall into one basket, those slightly less correlated in another, and so on, until each stock is placed into a category.
